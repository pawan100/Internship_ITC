### Integrated Land Cover, Temperature and Precipitation Information System

**Introduction:**

The system provides a user interface that visualizes data collected from different data providers, integrating it with near real-time climate and weather datasets. It was tested for rural mountain communities particularly those in the Dolakha district of Nepal. The result illustrates system can provide information such as present land use status, near real-time rainfall and temperature details, and present adapted techniques that enable communities and its Stakeholders to formulate a plan for coping the climate change. Overall, the system aims to support simple and easy access, visualizations and querying of the information for the relevant stakeholders, individuals, and communities.
